When trying to break into a company you can use a REVERSE SHELL that allows you to remotely execute commands.
Even after the vulnerability that let you in is fixed it allows the hacker to still have access.

SOCKET Programming

SOCKET is an API that allows programs to communicate over the network [TCP and UDP]

TCP is used when all data needs to be sent reliably

UDP is used in audio or video calls when real-time delivery is important.

TCP Handshakes
---
-Each packet is assigned a sequence number representing its place in the transmission.
-If a packet within the sequence is missing TCP will know it is missing and try to retransmit.
-TCP packets have a max size of 64KB, so a file any larger is divided into several TCP Packets.
-Sequence numbers are consecutive to allow the recipient to know the proper order, 
however each machine starts the sequence with a random number to keep hackers from predicting the sequence.

TCP Three-Way Handshake
SYN(x) -> SYN(y) ACK(x+1) -> ACK(y+1)
1. Sends the server a SYN packet [TCP packet with the SYN value set to true] (Contains the clients starting sequence number)
2. One the the server receives the SYN packet it records the clients sequence number and responds by sending a SYN-ACK request. (This acknowledges what was given and sends the servers sequence number)
3. However, the connection is not established until the server receives a follow up ACK from the client to confirm.
4. Once the system has finished exchanging packets. They close the connection through the FIN and ACK packets

TCP Allows for Full-Duplex communication which means the sender and reciever can transmit data at the same time.

Half duplex can only have one party transmitting at a time.

In a Full Duplex connection if one side sends a FIN packet the connection does not end until the other machine sends a FIN packet back

TCP Reverse Shell

SSH (Secure Shell) - Use sockets to connect to remote servers.
NAT (Network Address Translation) - Router uses the IP given by the modem to connect all the devices to the router.

Firewalls - These along with the NAT (routers) prevent machines outside the network form initiating connections to servers inside the network.
However, many firewalls allow the reverse: machines inside can still connect to machines outside the network.

To circumvent the firewall and NAT, hackers can install a program called a reverse chell on the compromised machine that will initiate a connection from within the network to the attackers computer outside.
They will be able to run commands as if they are inside as the attacker.
Many shells will mask their traffic bu using port 53 and encapsulating data in DNS packets.

REVERSE SHELL - contains 2 parts: A component that connects to the attackers computer AND shell component that allows the attacker to run commands on the victim computer.

Client-Server Model - Clients connect to and communicate with a dedicated server. EXAMPLE = web browser is a TCP Client that communicates with Google's TCP web server on 172.217.12.238 port 80.

Peer-to-Peer - Exchange information directly with one another.
